          I'm a Computer Science major at Purdue University who's planning to specialize in Machine Intelligence and Computational Science and Engineering. I managed Mask Mandator as we expanded beyond being a weekend long project. I also focused on the development of the AI systems in Mask Mandator and integrating Google Cloud Technologies, like BigQuery, into our code. I'm an avid enthusiast of intelligent computer systems for applications in space and the physical sciences. I enjoy working on innovative and novel solutions through research at both Purdue and DOE National Labs, and my future most likely lies somewhere in this realm. Feel free to contact me using the link below for any inquiries! </p>

          I am a Computer Science Major at Purdue University, who hopes to specialize in Artificial Intelligence and Software Engineering. For Mask Mandator, I focused more on the front-end by developing the website, 3D printed case, and video presentation. Through this project, I have gained a better understanding of front-end development and utilizing javascript plugins as well as AJAX. My plans for the future consist of learning more about the software engineering industry through employment. Outside of Computer Science, I enjoy tackling new projects and learning new techniques such as music production and video editing. If you enjoyed the project, please feel free to connect with me on LinkedIn! </p>

        <p class="head" style="text-align: center; margin-left: 5vw;"> 
          I'm a Computer Science major at Purdue University and willing to specialize in AI/Machine Learning. For Mask Mandator, I initially worked on the preparation of a second-hand machine learning model and integration. When it was expanded, I worked on the development of the website. Going through challenges, I acquired more knowledge of the nature of machine learning, full stack integration, web development, and the kinds of services that are available and employable from Google Cloud. Subsequently, I truly desire to contribute to the enhancement of Machine Learning technology and further create related products so that people may live easier lives. At the same time, I am interested in mobile application development as I plan to develop and publish many in the future. Please feel free to connect/contact me on LinkedIn or on any other available social media as you wish. </p>
