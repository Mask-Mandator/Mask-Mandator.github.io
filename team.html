          I am a Computer Science Major at Purdue University, who hopes to specialize in Artificial Intelligence and Software Engineering. For Mask Mandator, I focused more on the front-end by developing the website, 3D printed case, and video presentation. Through this project, I have gained a better understanding of front-end development and utilizing javascript plugins as well as AJAX. My plans for the future consist of learning more about the software engineering industry through employment. Outside of Computer Science, I enjoy tackling new projects and learning new techniques such as music production and video editing. If you enjoyed the project, please feel free to connect with me on LinkedIn! </p>
